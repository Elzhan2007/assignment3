**Student:** Yelzhan Zhandos
**Group:** SE-2426

## 1. Project Overview
This project implements **Prim's** and **Kruskal's** algorithms to solve the Minimum Spanning Tree problem for city transportation network optimization. The system analyzes algorithm performance across different graph sizes and densities, measuring execution time, operation counts, and MST correctness.

**Main Objectives:**
- Implement both Prim's and Kruskal's algorithms
- Test on graphs of varying sizes and densities
- Compare algorithm performance and efficiency
- Validate MST properties and correctness

## 2. Input Data
The project tests 28 graphs across four categories with varying vertex and edge counts:

| Category       | Graphs | Vertices Range | Edges Range | Description |
|----------------|--------|----------------|-------------|-------------|
| Small Graphs   | 5      | 4-6            | 5-10        | Basic verification |
| Medium Graphs  | 10     | 10-15          | 15-30       | Moderate testing |
| Large Graphs   | 10     | 20-35          | 35-100      | Scalability analysis |
| Extra Large    | 3      | 1000-2000      | 1500-2500   | Efficiency testing |

## 3. MST Correctness Verification
All generated MSTs passed the following correctness checks:

**Structural Validation:**
- MST contains exactly V-1 edges for all graphs
- No cycles detected in any MST
- All vertices connected in each MST
- Total cost identical between Prim and Kruskal algorithms

**Results:**
| Graph Size | Vertices | Edges | Prim Cost | Kruskal Cost | Match |
|------------|----------|-------|-----------|--------------|-------|
| Small 1    | 4        | 6     | 17        | 17           | Yes   |
| Medium 3   | 12       | 20    | 84        | 84           | Yes   |
| Large 5    | 25       | 40    | 163       | 163          | Yes   |

## 4. Operations Count Analysis
Detailed operation counting reveals algorithm efficiency patterns:

**Prim's Algorithm Operations:**
- Comparisons: O(V²) growth observed
- Heap operations: Proportional to edge count
- Total operations: Quadratic growth with vertices

**Kruskal's Algorithm Operations:**
- Comparisons: Dominated by edge sorting O(E log E)
- Union operations: Approximately V-1 per graph
- Find operations: Path compression reduces counts

**Operation Count Comparison:**
| Graph Size | Prim Operations | Kruskal Operations | Ratio |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|-------|
| Small      | 47-112          | 18-35             | 2.8x  |
| Medium     | 185-498         | 42-97             | 4.3x  |
| Large      | 723-1983        | 87-281            | 7.8x  |

## 5. Execution Time Performance
Execution time measurements (milliseconds) reveal clear performance patterns across different graph sizes:

**Observation:** Prim's algorithm consistently faster on small graphs due to Kruskal's sorting overhead.
